* Pivotal Command Center 2.0 deployed
* Pivotal HD deployed
* [Development Environment setup](../setting-development.html)

Approach
--------
*  Understand the Data formats

##Working with the Tutorial

###Step 1: Clone the source from the git repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rajdeepd/pivotal-samples.git
```
This will create pivotal-samples directory.

###Step 2: Importing the project to Eclipse IDE

Import the sample `PostalCodes-PaidAmount-Tax` project into eclipse using the instructions given in the [Setting Development Environment](../setting-development.html). 

###Step 3: Understand the Data formats
Data Header is shown below:

```xml
order_id  | customer_id | store_id  |   order_datetime       |ship_completion_datetime | 
 
return_datetime   |   refund_datetime   | payment_method_code |total_tax_amount | 

total_paid_amount | total_item_quantity | total_discount_amount |coupon_code    | 

coupon_amount | order_canceled_flag | has_returned_items_flag |has_refunded_items_flag | 

fraud_code | fraud_resolution_code | billing_address_line1 |billing_address_line2 |

billing_address_line3 | billing_address_city | billing_address_state |billing_address_postal_code | 

billing_address_country | billing_phone_number | customer_name   |

customer_email_address  | ordering_session_id  | website_url
```
 

Data separated by `\t`  is shown below:

```xml
8180565407	49711957	69	2010-10-07 08:48:35	2010-10-10 03:01:47

```



###Step 4:  Decide on the Input and output formats
The data is in text format, has the fields separated by `\t`. It is well structured for processing. We will use TextInputFormat which is subclass of FileInputFormat as the InputFormat. By defualt, map function gets one line at a time for processing.

###Step 5: Designing the Mapper
We are interested in postal code and that tax amounts in every row. 
In the Mapper code. we will extract `billing_address_postal_code` as key and  `total_tax_amount` and `total_paid_amount` as value. Since we are selecting two fields as values, we will separate the fileds by `,` as the separator.

#### Mapper code:

```java

 @Override
    protected void map(LongWritable offset, Text text, Context context)
        throws IOException, InterruptedException {
    String[] tokens = text.toString().split("\t");
    String total_tax_amount = tokens[8];
    String total_paid_amount = tokens[9];
    String billing_address_postal_code = tokens[24];
    key.set(Integer.parseInt(billing_address_postal_code));
    val.set(total_tax_amount + "," + total_paid_amount);
    context.write(key, val);
	}
```

###Step 6: Designing the Reducer  
The Reducer is also a simple one similar to the classic wordcount example. In this case, we are finding the sum of all tax amounts for each postal code, which is passed as a key.
Since we are interested in finding the top ten postal codes by revenue, we will initialize the a TreeMap, which automatically sorts our data. The tree map is initialized in the setup time and the output is written during the cleanup time. We could use the combiner to reduce the data further. That will be another exercise.

```java
    @Override
    protected void reduce(IntWritable key, Iterable<Text> counts,
        Context context) throws IOException, InterruptedException {
    StringBuffer temp;
    double total_tax_amount = 0;
    double total_paid_amount = 0;
    Text result = new Text();
    for (Text val : counts) {
        String[] rawTokens = val.toString().split(",");
        StringBuffer tax_amount = new StringBuffer(rawTokens[0]);
        StringBuffer paid_amount = new StringBuffer(rawTokens[1]);
        total_paid_amount = total_paid_amount
                + Double.parseDouble(paid_amount.toString());
        total_tax_amount = total_tax_amount
                + Double.parseDouble(tax_amount.toString());
        }

        temp = new StringBuffer(key.toString());
        temp.append("\t");
        temp.append(new StringBuffer(String.valueOf(total_paid_amount)));
        temp.append("\t");
        temp.append(new StringBuffer(String.valueOf(total_tax_amount)));

        result.set(temp.toString());

        recordRepo.put(total_paid_amount, result);
        if (recordRepo.size() > 10) {
            recordRepo.remove(recordRepo.firstKey());
        }
    }

    @Override
    protected void cleanup(org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.Reducer.Context context)
        throws IOException, InterruptedException {
        for (Text t : recordRepo.descendingMap().values()) {
            context.write(NullWritable.get(), t);
        }
        super.cleanup(context);
    }

```

###Step 7: Writing the MapReduce Driver Code

```java
    Job job = new Job(getConf());
    job.setJarByClass(PostalCodesPaidAmountTaxDriver.class);

    FileInputFormat.setInputPaths(job, new Path(args[0]));
    Path outputPath = new Path(args[1]);
    outputPath.getFileSystem(job.getConfiguration()).delete(outputPath,
                true);

    job.setMapperClass(PostalCodesMapper.class);
    job.setReducerClass(PostalCodesReducer.class);

    FileOutputFormat.setOutputPath(job, new Path(args[1]));

    job.setMapOutputKeyClass(IntWritable.class);
    job.setMapOutputValueClass(Text.class);

    job.setOutputKeyClass(NullWritable.class);
    job.setOutputValueClass(Text.class);
    job.setNumReduceTasks(1);
    job.waitForCompletion(true);
      
```

We are setting the number of reducers to one, so that, we can calculate the top ten postal codes by revenue. This could reduce the performance if the data is huge. This can be solved by using combiners and chaining the tasks.

###Step 7: Running the tutorial in command line
The following instructions can be used to run the sample on the Pseudo distributed cluster.

####Building the project 

Go to the project directory

```bash
cd  pivotal-samples
ls
cd PostalCodes-PaidAmount-Tax
```
Build the project

```bash 
mvn clean compile
mvn -DskipTests package
```

####Set the environment

Make sure the following environment variable are set.

```bash
 export HADOOP_HOME=$HOME/hadoop-2.0.3-alpha
 export HADOOP_MAPRED_HOME=$HOME/hadoop-2.0.3-alpha
 export HADOOP_COMMON_HOME=$HOME/hadoop-2.0.3-alpha
 export HADOOP_HDFS_HOME=$HOME/hadoop-2.0.3-alpha
 export YARN_HOME=$HOME/hadoop-2.0.3-alpha
 export HADOOP_CONF_DIR=$HOME/hadoop-2.0.3-alpha/etc/hadoop
 export JAVA_HOME=$HOME/java/jdk1.7.0_17
 export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin:$HADOOP_HOME/bin
```

Note: The step assumes that, you have set up the local machine to run hadoop in Psuedo distributed mode.

####Upload the input

```bash
hadoop fs -put input/orders.tsv /user/gpadmin/sample1/input
```

####Submit the job

```bash
hadoop jar target/PostalCodes-PaidAmount-Tax-1.0.jar com.pivotal.hadoop.PostalCodesPaidAmountTaxDriver /user/gpadmin/sample1/input /user/gpadmin/sample1/output
```

####Check the output

Verify the job in the hadoop cluster.

Check the output directory in hadoop file system. The output directory should contain the part-r-0000-file.

See the output using

```bash
hadoop fs -cat /user/gpadmin/sample1/output/part-r-00000

```

###Step 8: Running the tutorial on Pivotal HD Cluster

####Transfer the code to a node to the cluster. Let us assume it is one of the datanode.
Execute the following commands on the development machine.

```bash
tar -zcvf sample1.tar.gz target/* input/*
scp sample1.tar.gz gpadmin@DATA_NODE:/home/gpadmin/sample1.tar.gz 
```
Note: Replace the DATA_NODE with the hostname where one of the datanode is running.

####Extract the Archive
Login to datanode and extract the `sample1.tar.gz` to a directory. This will create a target folder.

```bash
cd /home/gpadmin
mkdir PostalCodes-PaidAmount-Tax
cd PostalCodes-PaidAmount-Tax
tar -zxvf ../sample1.tar.gz 
```
####Upload the datasets to HDFS

```bash
hadoop fs -mkdir -p /user/gpadmin/sample1/input
hadoop fs -put input/orders.tsv /user/gpadmin/sample1/input
```

####Submit the Job

```bash
hadoop jar target/PostalCodes-PaidAmount-Tax-1.0.jar com.pivotal.hadoop.PostalCodesPaidAmountTaxDriver /user/gpadmin/sample1/input /user/gpadmin/sample1/output
```

####Check the output

Verify the job in the hadoop cluster as shown below:

![Job Command Center](/images/gs/mapreduce/sample1.png)

Click View more job details to see the job details as shown below:

![Job Details](/images/gs/mapreduce/sample1-details.png)

Check the output directory in hadoop file system. The output directory should contain the part-r-0000-file.

See the output using

```bash
hadoop fs -cat /user/gpadmin/sample1/output/part-r-00000

```

You have successfully run the sample on Pivotal HD Cluster!.
