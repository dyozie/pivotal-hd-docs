Overview
--------

Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence concerned with techniques that allow computers to
improve their outputs based on previous experiences.. The field is closely related to data mining and often
uses techniques from statistics, probability theory, pattern recognition, and a host of other areas.
Although machine learning is not a new field, it is definitely growing. Many large companies like Google, Amazon, Yahoo!, and Facebook, have implemented machine-learning algorithms in their applications.

Many more companies would benefit from leveraging machine learning in their applications to learn from users and past situations.
